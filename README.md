# ListusingStack-implementing-ListInterface
A class called ListUsingStack. This class implements the ListInterface. However, the ListUsingStack class only allows to have two instance variables: an instance of the Java API Stack class and an int. The class is written using generic types. The only data structures used while implementing this class are primitives and other instances of the Java API Stack class. The only methods invoked on the Stack class are empty(), peek(), pop(), and push(). In addition to the ListUsingStack class, there is a JUnit class call TestListUsingStack which tests all of the methods in the ListUsingStack class. A sample ListInterface interface class is provided.
